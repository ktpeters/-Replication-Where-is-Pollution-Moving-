Replication of Shapiro and Walker 2021 paper: Do US air pollution offset markets disproportionately relocate pollution to or from low-income or minority communities? 

Purpose: creates datasets linking facility ID with latitude longitude coordinates, 
    which is input to compute facility's spatial intersection with census block groups
 (Original performed by R code - codeR/spatial_intersection.r, replication done in STATA)
